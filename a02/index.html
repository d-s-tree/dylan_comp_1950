      	<h2>About Awajishima</h2>
      	<p>Awajishima (Awaji Island in English) is one of the seven main islands that makes up the country of Japan. It is located between Japan's main island, honshu, and third largest island, Shikoku. It is connected to the mainland near the city of Kobe to the northeast by the world's longest suspension bridge, and to the southwest by a series of smaller bridges.</p><br>
      	<p>Awaji is home to about 150000 people who live mostly near the east coast. On this coast lie the hubs of the three city regions that make up the island: Awaji-shi, Sumoto-shi, and Minamiawaji-shi (south Awaji city). </p>

						<p>Akashi bridge is not really an attraction, but it is the way most people access the island. It is the longest suspension type bridge in the world, and also the most expensive toll bridge in the world! Additionally, because the island is not connected by train, to access the island from the northeast the bridge is your only option. While it is impressive and is lit up nicely in the daytime, I can't help but remember all the money I spent on highway tolls whenever I think of it.</p>

						<p>Yumeibutai means "dream stage" in English. It is a combination garden, art exhibit, hotel and spa. The main building is a kind of cement labrynth with the main draw being a large stepped garden. The park and attractions are different depending on the season. A large, shallow pool had walking steps and gazebos when I first went there, but when I went back in the winter they were gone. The main restaurant serves classic Awaji dishes (classic in Awaji means made with lots of onions) such as curry and..curry. I only remember the curry. It was good, though! Overall this park is a kind of surreal landscape that you won't find in any of Japan's metropolitan areas and worth a visit.</p>

						<p>Ohama beach is the main beach near Sumoto and is full of families and young people barbequing in the summer. In the spring and fall while it is still warm, it is almost deserted while still being very pleasant for sitting and staring at the water even if it is not warm enough for swimming (the ocean is never warm enough for swimming for me though). The beach is sandy, not rocky, and large trees near the parking lot provide shade if needed. Grabbing a warm tea from the nearby convenience stores and going down to the beach to stare out over the water was a perfect afternoon for me.</p>

						<p>Drive along a windy road after a few unmarked turnoffs, and eventually you will arrive at the bottom of Mount Yuzuruha. From here to the peak is an easy two hour hike where you probably won't encounter many people. Despite this, even in bad weather you can find a takoyaki takeout truck in the parking lot ready to serve you hot gooey balls of goodness. <br><br>In the spring the cherry blossoms bloom at the base, and on New Year's Day you can visit the small shrine at the top. </p>
